## 1. Project Goal

The objective of this project is to document the complete deployment of the "RoboShop" e-commerce application. This repository serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in cloud infrastructure setup, manual application deployment, and DevOps automation practices.

## 2. Application Architecture Overview

The RoboShop application is designed based on a classic **Three-Tier Architecture**, which is a standard pattern for building resilient and scalable web applications. This architecture separates the system into logical tiers, each with a distinct responsibility. This separation enhances security, simplifies maintenance, and allows for independent scaling of each layer.

Below is a diagram illustrating the component communication flow and architectural layout that I followed for this deployment.

**(Action Item for You): Your first task is to create your own version of this architecture diagram. Do not use the one from your course. Use a free tool like `app.diagrams.net` (draw.io) and create a clear, professional diagram. This is a crucial step to demonstrate personal effort.**

### Tier 1: Presentation Tier (Frontend)
This is the user-facing layer that delivers the user interface.
*   **Technology:** It's built with modern frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **Serving Stack:** I will be using **Nginx** as the web server to serve the static content and to act as a reverse proxy for the backend services. Nginx is chosen for its high performance and stability in production environments.

### Tier 2: Application Tier (Backend Microservices)
This tier contains the business logic of the application. It's composed of several independent microservices.
*   **Key Principle:** The backend services are not exposed directly to the public internet. Access is controlled strictly through the Frontend (Nginx proxy), which provides a single, secure entry point.
*   **Technologies:** The various services use different technologies (NodeJS, Java, Python). A key feature of modern backend development is the use of self-contained services with embedded servers, which simplifies deployment.

### Tier 3: Database & Persistence Tier (Data Storage)
This tier is responsible for all stateful data storage, caching, and messaging.
*   **Databases:**
    *   **MongoDB (NoSQL):** Used for storing unstructured or semi-structured data like product catalogs.
    *   **MySQL (SQL):** Used for transactional data requiring high consistency, such as user information and orders.
*   **Caching:**
    *   **Redis:** Implemented as a high-speed, in-memory cache to reduce latency for frequently accessed data, ensuring a fast user experience.
*   **Asynchronous Communication:**
    *   **RabbitMQ:** A message queue (MQ) is used to handle asynchronous communication between services. For example, when an order is placed, the shipping service can be notified via a message, decoupling the services from each other.
